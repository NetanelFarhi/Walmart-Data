The table itself is heavy/sturdy but light/small enough for me to move it by myself. Really perfect for small spaces such as a studio apartment.

LEDs worked great, though I do wish the cord for them was longer. Im not sure where you are expected to put it without it being exposed/a tripping hazard. I dont have kids or animals so I am personally not worried about the safety aspects, but rather the aesthetics of an exposed black wire against a white table and rug. 

The drawers are a bit smaller than I had hoped for (I struggle to fit a 4x5 foot thin blanket in them) but that can be expected with a small piece of furniture that offers 4 drawers. Ultima...",Melanie,Walmart,3 out of 5 stars review,09/09/2021,15/03/2024

Buy your phones on Amazon or in your carriers store.

The only con I've noticed about the A14 is the basic camera (too white, too much exposure, comparable to older model galaxies). Another con about this phone is when you are playing mobile games, it can get laggy.

I was debating between this phone or the moto g stylus 4g. I only chose this phone due to two factors. The website said it had 6gb of RAM, and I'm able to turn developer mode on and force my apps to the SD card for more internal storage on the device.

I bought this for $106.87 after tax, pulled it out of the box and booted it up and got it set up. 

The camera quality is not the best, even after device update. I feel like I'm using an A03s camera model. Both selfie and other cameras are a little grainy, it's not bad but definitely not the best for $100.

Thus, if you want the tablet to actually hold up for kids, I‚Äôd say go another route. The platform isn‚Äôt bad though.",Robert,Walmart,2 out of 5 stars review,02/01/2023,15/03/2024

Love that you can pick books to read, play math games, read interesting facts or find something that interests you!  There's a whole board of suggestions. You do have to have internet to use it, or maybe pre-downloaded material.  Some of the apps are free and some you have to purchase.  I can't figure out how to tell that before downloading, so that was the only frustrating part.

The processor is fast enough to stream YouTube Kids, as well as his apps. The battery lasts a good long while on a single charge, as we learned on the first day (he didn't want to put it down!). The kickstand is a little weird, as it rotates and partially detaches, but we don't really use that feature. The rubber guard is nice and sturdy, and easy for small hands to grip.

The noise cancelation is decent, but I've experienced better from other earbuds. I can't comment on the call quality, as I use these strictly for music. I tried out the various equalizer settings through the app and settled on Acoustic and I have yet to find a song it doesn't sound great on.

Color (red) is nice and makes finding them easier when they constantly fall from my ear holes. 

Pairing is super easy, and battery status display is nice.  This way you can keep track of how quickly the battery life is depleting in the charging case, and your ear buds.  

Cons:

Battery does not last in buds or case. One charge and it is depleted. 

Not secure in your ear and falls out constantly.

Pros- 
Color (red) is nice and makes finding them easier when they constantly fall from my ear holes. 

Pairing is super easy, and battery status display is nice.  This way you can keep track of how quickly the battery life is depleting in the charging case, and your ear buds.  

Cons:

Battery does not last in buds or case. One charge and it is depleted. 

Not secure in your ear and falls out constantly. 

Incessant notifications of battery level, that begins at 20% and flashes on and off your screen non stop!! Mine is currently doing it right now!!

Design: The small case features a sleek design with a streamlined look and bold branding. It's easy to carry around. The charging cable is USB-C to USB-C, and it comes with 2 extra silicon ear-tips.
Fitting: Due to my small ears, the buds don't stay in, and I had to purchase custom ear tips for them to stay in place.
Connectivity: They connect effortlessly to the iPhone, almost as if they were AirPods.
Control: Each bud has a physical control button that allows you to play/pause, play the previous track, or turn them off. However, adjusting the volume using the control button is not possible.

Only giving this two stars because they work. 



Pros- 
Color (red) is nice and makes finding them easier when they constantly fall from my ear holes. 

Pairing is super easy, and battery status display is nice.  This way you can keep track of how quickly the battery life is depleting in the charging case, and your ear buds.  

Cons:

Battery does not last in buds or case. One charge and it is depleted. 

Not secure in your ear and falls out constantly. 

Incessant notifications of battery level, that begins at 20% and flashes on and off your screen non stop!! Mine is currently doing it right now!!

643659699,Back to Beats Studio Buds ‚Äì True Wireless Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds - Black,Electronics,Okay earbuds,"I'll keep my review short and sweet. These earbuds are a great option for anyone looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds that offer a sleek design,  balanced sound, and active noise cancellation. It's handy that they're compatible with both Apple and Android devices, and support spatial audio for a more immersive listening experience. 

However, they also have some pretty glaring drawbacks, such as pretty mediocre call quality, lack of an Apple H1 chip (which makes a seamless transition from one Apple device to another not possible), and average battery life. They are not the best in their class, but they are still worth considering for their price and performance.",James,Walmart,4 out of 5 stars review,9/26/2023,15/03/2024

Anyone who wants fidelity in sound should look for something more expensive that suits his preferences.  For me these are very good for their price.

643659699,Back to Beats Studio Buds ‚Äì True Wireless Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds - Black,Electronics,Beats??? More like deadbeats.,"Really expected more from this brand. 

Only giving this two stars because they work. 



Pros- 
Color (red) is nice and makes finding them easier when they constantly fall from my ear holes. 

Pairing is super easy, and battery status display is nice.  This way you can keep track of how quickly the battery life is depleting in the charging case, and your ear buds.  

Cons:

Battery does not last in buds or case. One charge and it is depleted. 

Not secure in your ear and falls out constantly. 

Incessant notifications of battery level, that begins at 20% and flashes on and off your screen non stop!! Mine is currently doing it right now!! 

Save your money, and just get the darn AirPods

This 50 inch is a smart 4K with chromecast built in. It was $248 which is about $200 less than what I paid for the 37 inch.
I have streaming apps on my phone and iPad and I can select a movie and start it on my tv. Also have the same apps on the tv but I think being able to do it with my phone or iPad is easier and faster.

And that's with putting the phone near the speaker so that it's not trying to bounce a signal halfway across the room and around 3 corners.  I'm going to fully charge it this weekend and see what battery life I get while at home.  I'm hoping it's just the work environment and not the  actual speaker battery.

625340678,"Back to JBL Charge 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker with Powerbank, Black",Electronics,Nice upgrade.,I went down the review line and read this reviews and nobody seems to mention the sound muffle if you are holding the charge 5 on the exclamation j side. The tweeter is producing most of the sound. I reviewed the charge 4 and the only gripe I had with that was to move the driver to the center instead of one side for balanced  sound  that way if you grab it from any end you still hear sound instead of blockage. It's the same with the charge 5 you have to watch how you hold or grab it to not block sound. Sound quality is amazing just wish they could of move the smaller jbl logo to the upper right or left side and put the single driver dead in the center. Just my humble opinion.

After buying three identical pair and returning them all for a refund, I honestly believe that mine must have been the last good pair they made, neither of us were impressed.

That multi-function button is a mess, too. With modern electronics, you know it won't be long before it gets mushy and hard to control. You'll have to learn the push-combos ahead of time, and remember them on-the-fly.

noise cancelling is pretty  much non existent.  I'm sitting in the living room, can still hear the fan running, someone mowing the lawn, people talking almost as if I had nothing on.  I've had other noise cancelling and it pretty much muted my surroundings.  this just turns it down one notch.  
the controls for volume up/down are stupid. you have to hold them, can't just click the button up/down. if you click the button up/down it goes to next/previous track, ugh.  one button that does everything, and I'm here counting ""one one thousand, two one thousand"" to make sure I get the proper function I needed.  stupid.

For most people, it might be a tad too bassy to be an enjoyable ex...",Em,Walmart,4 out of 5 stars review,06/02/2019,15/03/2024

The packaging is real sleek and very high end. The headphones did need to charge for about three hours out of the box, but once ready they easily paired to my laptop and phone easily. The instructions are very thorough and give all you need to operate the headphones. The wear is good and they aren't too heavy. They fit comfortably on my ears and I listened to music and watched a show with no problem. They don't feel as though they would easily slip off and had great sound.

I did purchase 2 yr warranty through Walmart for an additional $3 which still came out to under $50 dollars.

I brought 2 iPhone 11 on black friday for Christmas for my kids. I tried to activate them, but I couldn't on Christmas Eve. That's because walmart.com doesn't scan the serial number and the IMEI bar code before you get it. That's makes it look like no one brought the phone so it seems stolen to the carrier. You have to go to a Walmart store in customer service and show them proof on your online receipt along with your phones. They have to scan both the serial number and the IMEI bar codes to activate them by price overriding to 0 dollars and then call straight talk to handle the rest.

At first they told me to call FedEx. And then they told me I have to call my financial institution. I called FedEx and they said that Walmart simply needs to file a claim with them, and that it will get paid and research. Chances are, since the box was repackaged at their facility, it was lost or stolen.

5020133971,Back to AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with MagSafe Case (USB‚ÄëC),Electronics,Disappointing experience with walmart-purchased,"I'm disappointed with my purchase of the second-generation AirPods Pro from Walmart. Upon receiving the product, I noticed that the box lacked the protective plastic that usually indicates it hasn't been previously opened. Additionally, the security seal was broken, and the box was dirty, suggesting potential tampering or prior handling. This lack of integrity in the packaging raises concerns about the authenticity and condition of the product. As a consumer, I expected to receive a new and unaltered product, which wasn't the case this time. This experience has been quite disappointing, and I hope for a resolution or clarification from Walmart to ensure the quality and authenticity of their products.",Anonymous,Walmart,1 out of 5 stars review,12/19/2023,15/03/2024

This is my fourth pair from Beats with this being my third Studios.  These new ones feel like Solo‚Äôs, not the step up to Studio, so I‚Äôm wondering if it has something to do with the fact that they make Studio pros now‚Ä¶. One of the earpieces is seemingly permanently bent funky and the silicone‚Äôish material on the insides of the band doesn‚Äôt fit properly and looks bad.

The problem is they cancel absolutely no sound at all.  Which is what I bought them for. I listen to a lot of audio books and was excited to get these to drown everything around me while listening. 

I stood by a window fan while the book was playing and unless I turned the volume up extremely high I could still here the fan. So I doubt very much if these will drown out noise on an airplane or music on the radio in a car. Since I do not listen to music this was another draw for noise canceling head phones. But if I have to turn them up so high it busts my eardrums then I don‚Äôt call that noise canceling.

817684947,Back to Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Apple W1 Headphone Chip- Matte Black,Electronics,"Good headphones, not great value.","The Beats Studio3 Wireless headphones offer excellent sound quality and are comfortable to wear.  Although they do sound good, I would not say they sound as good as the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones for about the same price. There seems to be two different versions of this headset Model MW562LL/A ($289.99 MSRP) and MX32XLL/A($349.95 MSRP).  The only difference seems to be Pure Adaptive Noice Cancellation vs Active Noise Cancelling.  Not sure how these differ.  The case is a bit small and does not have a dedicated place to hold the charge cable or the headphone aux cable.   Overall good headphones but would wait for a Black Friday sale.",SaylorTwift,Walmart,4 out of 5 stars review,12/16/2023,15/03/2024
817684947,Back to Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Apple W1 Headphone Chip- Matte Black,Electronics,Okay for audio but overpriced,"Noise cancellation not very good‚Ä¶ there is a very noticeable hissing when activated. Rather boomy bass response; no equalization options. Since Beats is now owned by Apple and these use much of their technology, it would seem reasonable that they also incorporate other Apple technology.

The AirPods Pro 2 have better sound, noise cancellation and integrated features. And they are currently priced $150 less.",Joe,Walmart,4 out of 5 stars review,12/14/2023,15/03/2024

817684947,Back to Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Apple W1 Headphone Chip- Matte Black,Electronics,Great set of headphones if found on sale.,Bought these on Black Friday for $99.00. At this price point it would be hard to find another brand that compares. Noise canceling works great. To the point I give up on trying to get my son‚Äôs attention while he‚Äôs wearing them.  I‚Äôm not an audiophile by any means but there is a noticeable difference between these and a more expensive pair such as the Sony WH-1000XM5 That‚Äôs not to say they sound bad because they certainly don‚Äôt but if paying full price for these I would consider possibly looking at some of the other more high end headphones.

They come with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) which is great for tuning out background noise, making them ideal for commuting or in noisy environments. The sound quality is impressive with a bass-heavy profile, which is a signature of the Beats brand. This makes them particularly enjoyable for genres like hip-hop and EDM.

They're also quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the cushioned ear cups. The battery life is another strong point, offering up to 22 hours with ANC on, and even more with it off.

817684947,Back to Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Apple W1 Headphone Chip- Matte Black,Electronics,Poor Quality,"The ear pads, are very poorly made. You can see where  the cushion separates, and is gapped, and stitching isn't straight, causes the fabric to pucker, as well as causing them to have an odd shape all the way around, inside and outside of the ear pieces.  This makes the headphones appear to be knock off, and fake, which raises a red flag about the authenticity of this item. 

I'm very disappointed, as well as dissatisfied with the purchase of these headphones.  I've purchased Beats for myself in the past, and liked them so much that I bought more, and gifted them to family members. I definitely will not be gifting these in the future.",Sandra,Walmart,1 out of 5 stars review,No Date,15/03/2024

If you get anywhere near the speed Walmart advertises consider yourself extremely lucky. These speed performance is paltry for the class that they advertise this SD micro to be in.

Needless to say it's too costly to be wasting at least one or more pictures every time it's turned on.

The camera is kind of big and a tiny bit heavy. It comes with batteries! It's crazy that it takes 4 AA batteries. I highly recommend to take your pictures with a background behind you like a wall. Second, if you take a selfie, your picture will be a little blurry but you can tell who is in the picture. If you take a group picture too far then it will come out blurry.

Pros
-excellent price for -1440p @165hz
-32in and Freesync compatible
-didn't have dead pixels
Cons
-color is terrible, it is beige and washed out in tone (settings cannot remedy this, regardless of what you change)

The bad: The joystick OSD control doesn't respond really well. Never had this experience and I own 5 32 inch LG monitors.

I have a 27"" with 2560 x 1440 and it's crisp, but images and type are too small. This 32"" with 2560 x 1440 isn't as crisp because the pixels are spread over a larger area. 

That said, it's better than the 27"" 1920 x 1040 I had before, and with a little bit of tweaking to the brightness, contrast, gamma and vibrancy, it's pretty darn nice!

Another noticed was when this powers on, it sounds like crazy/ robot saying connection/ etc. So i have not try to disconnect it while on. but it is a bit scary/ may be problematic trying to re connect it.

At least 2 out of 3 times I attempt to press on of the top 3 buttons right handed, my middle finger MUTES the TV.
I tried left handed, and no problems.  My hands are average size for a man.
Since I am right-handed, (Like most people.) this means one of three things.
1. A left-handed person designed it.
2. An incompetent person designed it.
3. They decided making money are a bad thing.
There are 2 ways to fix this problem.

We even have a lot more channels.  We subscribed to a few %26 we now spend about $25 a month to watch tv.  Best decision ever!!!!,Maw,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,12/07/2023,15/03/2024
199415215,Back to Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Voice Remote with TV Controls and Long-Range Wi-Fi,Electronics,Works great! Not one problem after Customer‚Ä¶.,"‚Ä¶ Service found out that my TVs HDMI 1 wasn't working. Changing over to HDMI 2, finally did work.

Like the fact that I purchased the Stick with the remote having volume control and mute. My last ROKU did not have those functions, and it was frustrating trying to find the TVs remote. All in all, ROKU is a very cheap way to get free TV, until you can afford the other. You can also get paid movies or TV shows, you just have a choice at a cheaper value.",shelli,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,11/17/2023,15/03/2024
199415215,Back to Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Voice Remote with TV Controls and Long-Range Wi-Fi,Electronics,very clever idea and works well,I love the way it operates and how you can mirror your phone to it The only thing I don't like is the remote control if you want to go to channel 555 you have to search for it manually because there's no numbers on the remote to select. also I think it's weird with the volume on the side of the remote it's so easy to hit the volume button it's a weird place for a volume button my opinion.,mjricci,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,11/24/2023,15/03/2024
199415215,Back to Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Voice Remote with TV Controls and Long-Range Wi-Fi,Electronics,Love it,"We needed a Roku for our LG tv to be able to stream Spectrum. I bought the regular one first not the stick and loved it. Ended up buying the stick next for our other tv that we really didn't even need it on but makes it so much easier to watch tv and the stick doesn't show at all. I got the ones with the remotes that you can talk into, and it will find whatever you are looking for, which is great for husband who is not tech savvy and loves that feature.  All streaming apps on the same page no searching on bottom bar. You get free tv with Roku also so more to watch. Also, you can change the wallpaper and sound it makes when clicking to make it more personalized.  May get another one for last tv even though we don't use that one that much.

199415215,Back to Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Voice Remote with TV Controls and Long-Range Wi-Fi,Electronics,Excellent product,We previously had a fire stick that had become outdated and per multiple recommendations and after much research we decided to go with the Roku! The picture with the added UHD4K is amazing and crisp but oh my goodness the speed and lack of lag is where it's at for us! We have this on our outdoor TV and the difference with the WiFi amplifier has made this purchase phenomenal for us!,Melanie,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,12/19/2023,15/03/2024

Easy to use!","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 90 year old parents. It's simple to operate and was a breeze to install. I paid extra for the voice recognition thinking they might need it but think they would have no trouble operating without the voice control. 
Very happy I chose this unit!",cynthia,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,01/12/2024,15/03/2024
199415215,Back to Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Voice Remote with TV Controls and Long-Range Wi-Fi,Electronics,ROKU is so underrated!,"It's as if you're watching an actual ROKU TV. I know that's the point. Lol. What I mean is - it was so easy to set up. Works flawless and because of the Universal type remote, you have everything at your fingertips, to include Volume and the ability to change the source.  Switching easy to play your gaming system. I think it was $10 more for this remote, to be included with the ROKU stock‚ÄîSpend it! You will not be sorry!",Amy,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,01/09/2024,15/03/2024

Why didn't we do it sooner?  It's so great to have an extra tv with Roku for our guests.  We already have internet and Roku on others, and I'm not sure about the set up because my husband did it this time but I'm pretty sure he linked it to our preexisting plan.",Geri,Walmart,5 out of 5 stars review,11/30/2023,15/03/2024
